My name is Anderson Martins, Frontend Engineer & Fullstack Developer based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil — open to remote opportunities and relocation worldwide. With over 20 years of experience in UI Specialist Design and nearly 15 years in Web Development, I have contributed to over 100+ projects across sectors such as communications, education, fintech, healthcare, e-commerce, and government services, collaborating with companies like BairesDev, Globant, IBM, CNN Brazil, British Petroleum, Cars.com, and DealerInspire. My expertise includes HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, CSS Grid, Tailwind, Bootstrap, Sass, shadcn/ui, ChakraUI), JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, and advanced WordPress development (Custom Themes, Plugins, CPTs, ACF, Hooks, WP REST API).

I have experience with scalable architectures (Component-Based, SSR, SSG, JAMstack), and performance optimization. Beyond frontend, I bring fullstack experience with MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and Nest.js for building modern, and modular JavaScript applications. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in C# and ASP.NET Core (Razor, Blazor, Dapper, LINQ, Entity Framework, Web APIs). My studies cover Docker, Clean Code, Clean Architecture, Design Patterns, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), S.O.L.I.D, and Test-Driven Development (TDD). Also, I hold GraphQL Developer (Associate) and GitHub Foundations certifications, and am preparing for AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Developer Associate certifications.

I would be glad to discuss how my skills and experience can add value to your team.
