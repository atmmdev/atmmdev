  <h1>Anderson Toledo Martins Moreira</h1>
</div>

My name is Anderson Martins, and I began in 2000 as UI Specialist Designer, and with over 20 years of experience, I have worked in various roles, building solid expertise from initial project analysis to production deployment. These roles include UI Specialist Design, Frontend Software Developer, PHP Fullstack Developer, and WordPress Software Developer. My combined experience in design and development enables me to deliver complete and scalable solutions.

I have participated in over 200 projects, creating layouts for Websites, Web Applications, and Dashboards using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma. Since 2011, I have been working with WordPress, developing custom Plugins and Themes. I am proficient in Custom Post Types, Advanced Custom Fields, Hooks (Actions and Filters), WP REST API, and Page Builders such as Elementor, Visual Composer, Divi, and WP Bakery.

In 2014, I started working as Frontend Software Developer, and I deepened my knowledge of JavaScript, React.js, and Next.js, besides gaining strong expertise in responsive design (Flexbox, Grid Layout, Media Queries), performance optimization, and code maintenance. I also have experience with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), RESTful API development, and UI frameworks like Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, and SASS.

My goal is becoming a Frontend Staff Engineer, so I continuously expand my knowledge in TypeScript, GraphQL, Docker, Nest.js, Laravel, Design Patterns, and Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies to ensure high-quality code and stay updated through books, Udemy courses, and YouTube channels. In order to acquire knowledge in Cloud Computing, I started studying for the AWS certifications (Cloud Practitioner, Developer Associate, Solutions Architect).
