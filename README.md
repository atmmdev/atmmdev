  <h1>Anderson Toledo Martins Moreira</h1>

My name is Anderson Martins, and my journey began in 2000 as a UI Specialist Designer. With over 20 years of experience, I have built a robust and versatile skill set that spans from early-stage project analysis to scalable production deployment. Over the years, I’ve taken on multiple roles — including UI Specialist Designer, Frontend Software Developer, PHP Fullstack Developer, and WordPress Software Developer — working with renowned companies like BairesDev, Globant, IBM, British Petroleum, Cars.com, and DealerInspire, in applications for a wide range of industries, including communication, education, fintech, medical, e-commerce, and government services.

I have contributed to more than 100 projects, designing and developing user interfaces for websites, web applications, and data-driven dashboards. My design and prototyping toolkit includes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma. Since 2011, I have specialized in custom WordPress Development, building themes and plugins from scratch. My expertise includes Custom Post Types, Advanced Custom Fields, WordPress Hooks (Actions & Filters), WP REST API, and page builders like Elementor, Beaver Builder, WP Bakery, Oxygen, and Divi.

In 2014, I expanded my focus to Frontend Software Development, deepening my knowledge of JavaScript and modern frameworks like React.js and Next.js. I also have strong expertise in Responsive Web Design (Flexbox, CSS Grid, Media Queries), performance optimization, and scalable solutions. I am proficient in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), RESTful API integration, and modern UI libraries including Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and preprocessors like Sass.

Currently, my goal is to become a Frontend Staff Engineer within the next five years. To achieve this, I am continuously advancing my skills in TypeScript, GraphQL, Docker, NestJS, Laravel, software architecture, design patterns, and Test-Driven Development (TDD). I stay current through books, Udemy courses, and YouTube. Additionally, I am preparing for AWS certifications — Cloud Practitioner, Developer Associate, and Solutions Architect — to strengthen my capabilities in cloud-based architectures.
